# wiki.py
Welcome to the **official** GitHub repository for [wiki.py](https://replit.com/@roc0ast3r/wikipy), a wiki software using only the Python console. By the way, wiki.py is far from perfect. I know there are things that I need to fix here and there. You are welcome to fork this project and if I find your contribution useful, I'll integrate it with the current code (with credit of course). Here's some info on how to work it. If you want further information on wiki.py, you are free to check the wiki.
